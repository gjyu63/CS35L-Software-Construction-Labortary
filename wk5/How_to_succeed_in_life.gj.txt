To do this homework,
we are going to start with the file on hw 4.
challenges: sfrob -f; use system call rather than library function;

for sfrob f, there are two parts: parse the flag, and implement the function

what to start first??

better parse the argument first, then use system calls for input, then implement the -f functionality. 

how to test? 

what did mihir do that is relevant?

show how to deal with system call to read chars (better use anthony’s)

all done above

the next step is to write a shell script

1. how to take a flag as argument
2. how to use shell script to decode and compare

the work flow of this shell script:
to take argument, use condition statement
if nothing, decode -> sort -> encode
if -f, decode (wo/ case) -> sort -> encode

decode & encode becomes tricky cuz the de/en-code regulations have altered. 

we don’t have to do this. we can use sort -f



notice that jerry’s sol used oct value of ascii

also notice that we should consider the limit of toupper


what’s next

we are to 

/usr/local/cs/jdk*/jre/lib/rt.jar
